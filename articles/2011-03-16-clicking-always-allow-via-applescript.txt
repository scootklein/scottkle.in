title: Clicking "Always Allow" via applescript

Came across something nasty yesterday as we were looking into automating the building of iPhone apps with a dedicated mac mini. Anyone familiar with the certificate process of building and deploying iOS apps knows how much of a nightmare it can be.


Specifically, the first time codesign calls on a distribution certificate the user must authorize access for codesign to access the keychain. We have a headless mac mini and really don't want to have to baby sit it. After some tinkering and and googling for the last 6 hours or so, I finally was able to contrive an applescript that I put in a 1 second loop to just continually click "Always Allow" each time it popped up for access.


<code>
	#!/usr/bin/osascript
	tell application "System Events"
	   if (exists process "SecurityAgent") then
	      tell window 1 of process "SecurityAgent"
	         click button "Always Allow" of group 1
	      end tell
	   end if
	end tell
</code>
