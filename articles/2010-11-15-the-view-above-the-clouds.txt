I just got done spending an incredible two weeks with my girlfriend. She teaches on an Indian reservation in South Dakota as part of a program called Teach for America., and let's just suffice it to say that she's more compassionate, understanding, and badass than I could ever hope to be. I have an incredible respect for her job and the challenges she faces daily - yet another testament to walking a mile in a man's shoes.


My flight out of Pierre, SD took place on a particularly damp and overcast day; the kind of days I enjoy but that most people gripe about. The ascent was particularly smooth given the circumstances, and the photo above was taken just as we eclipsed the cloud cover and continued our climb to 33,000 feet.


Being above the clouds gives you a new perspective: every day is a sunny day. "Sad, rainy day" are what people without wings proclaim as they meander about the ground. Want to enjoy the ethos above the noise? Find your wings.
