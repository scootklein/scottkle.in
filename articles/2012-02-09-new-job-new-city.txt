title: New Job, New City

I have a new job. There's no title yet, and not sure when there will be one, but I have a new job. <a href="http://www.spreedly.com" target="_blank">Spreedly</a> is my new home for the time being, and I'm pretty damn excited.


After spending the last 15 months at <a href="http://www.reverbnation.com">ReverbNation</a> following the <a href="#">Sound Around</a> acquisition, I'm looking forward to getting back to a generalist role. Reverb has taught me more than I could have hoped to learn, but the company is at the point where it's needing more specialized roles. It's not me, and I'm not sure it will ever be. I saw us hire 30 more people after I joined as employee #20.


Making the move means that I'm getting back to working with Rails every day, and that I face again the awesome uncertainty that comes with new companies. Most of all, I get back to having a legitimate equity stake to make the emotional and physical commitment worthwhile.

Also, I now live in Durham. It was a quick move, but I'm happy it happened. The people I need to start spending more time with are in Durham, and now I'm just a bike ride away.
